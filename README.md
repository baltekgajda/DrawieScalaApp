Drawie is a desktop application designed to give you the ability to quickly visualize your ideas as drawings and share them with your friends. You can use it online with others or enjoy drawing offline in single-user mode. 

Web version of Drawie is also available - https://drawie.herokuapp.com.  It is fully compatible with our desktop application, so sharing drawings between app and browser is not a problem.
